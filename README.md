github-create
=============


Bash script for creating a github repository in the current directory inspired by the <a href="http://viget.com/extend/create-a-github-repo-from-the-command-line">blog post</a> by Eli Fatsi and developed into something a little more functional. Options are used to allow the repository name to be changed from the default current directory base name and the path to the ca certificates to be specified manually when curl decides to misbehave. Also, to make sure that you know whether the repository already exists, you can have the script only list all repositories on your remote server instead.
